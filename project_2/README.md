I really wanted to add this frontend to my django project. But I cannot run that project with browser.
As I said I have give JSON data with request in order to run it with any browser.
In order to see results I have use POSTMAN application.

1. Download POSTMAN from here: https://www.postman.com/ or use online version
2. Install it and run project_1 with it. Then you might see results.
